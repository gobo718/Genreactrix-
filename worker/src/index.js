Adorable is a narrow reaction to cuteness itself, not a general positive reaction to something pleasant, attractive, friendly, soft, or beautiful.\nRequired gate: Adorable should be supported only when the image contains clear cuteness-specific evidence. Valid routes include juvenile or baby-like traits, baby-schema proportions, tiny vulnerable proportions, plush or toy-like forms, cuddly presentation, affectionate dependence, innocent vulnerability, endearing clumsiness, deliberately cute or kawaii styling, or behavior that specifically evokes caretaking, cuddling, or an “aww” response.\nEvidence can include: Babies or visibly juvenile animals; disproportionately large eyes or head; round cheeks or face; small nose or mouth; tiny paws, limbs, or features; oversized ears; compact or chubby proportions; plushness; stuffed animals; cuddling; being held or cared for; shy, clumsy, dependent, trusting, or affection-seeking behavior; miniature versions of familiar things; cute costumes or accessories; and overt visual design intended to make a subject look precious, huggable, or childlike.\nHard non-qualifiers: Do not score Adorable merely because a subject is beautiful, attractive, smiling, friendly, harmless, pleasant, colorful, soft-lit, cozy, sentimental, feminine, small, young-looking, innocent-looking, or aesthetically pleasing. Smallness alone is not Adorable. Softness alone is not Adorable. Roundness alone is not Adorable. An animal or pet is not automatically Adorable. A cartoon or illustration is not automatically Adorable. A smiling or attractive adult is not Adorable without independent cuteness-specific evidence.\nAnti-fallback rule: Adorable must not be used as a safe default for positive images or as a substitute for Beautiful, Dreamy, Celebration, Zazzly, or general likability. If the image remains appealing after its specifically cute, juvenile, cuddly, vulnerable, or precious qualities are removed, that remaining appeal belongs to another reaction rather than Adorable.\n🧸 Emoji contribution: Teddy bears, stuffed animals, nursery objects, childhood keepsakes, cuddling, soft stuffed forms, being held or cared for, huggability, and sentimental affection reinforce Adorable only when they actively create cuteness, endearment, preciousness, cuddly appeal, or lovable vulnerability. Their mere presence is not sufficient."},{"id":"P02","name":"Beautiful","symbol":"✨","aiMeaning":"Aesthetic beauty from scenery, art, color, light, composition, harmony, symmetry, elegance, radiance, craftsmanship, architecture, design, polish, refinement, or overall visual presentation.\nHard boundary: Do not score Beautiful from a person's face, body, physique, skin, curves, musculature, clothing, pose, nudity, exposed skin, revealing or tight clothing, sensual presentation, or physical attractiveness. The presence or attractiveness of a person is not evidence for Beautiful. Human physical desirability and body-focused appeal belong to Zazzly.\nBeautiful may still score when non-human visual qualities of the image itself independently support it, such as scenery, composition, color, lighting, architecture, art, design, craftsmanship, symmetry, harmony, polish, or refinement."},{"id":"P03","name":"Tragic","symbol":"😭","aiMeaning":"Sadness, grief, loss, suffering, heartbreak, loneliness, helplessness, regret, emotional pain, sorrow, mourning, or sympathy for misfortune.\nEvidence can include: Crying, injury, death, abandonment, ruin, rejection, isolation, mourning, damaged relationships, painful circumstances, visible sorrow, grief-stricken expressions, or situations that evoke compassion for suffering.\n😭 Emoji contribution: Streaming tears, sobbing, emotional collapse, pleading expressions, devastation, heartbreak, helplessness, cathartic grief, painful emotional overflow, inconsolability, or being emotionally overwhelmed by suffering or loss can reinforce Tragic."},{"id":"P04","name":"Funny","symbol":"🤣","aiMeaning":"Humor, amusement, silliness, absurdity, comic surprise, awkward comedy, wit, ridiculousness, playful nonsense, or anything that provokes laughter.\nEvidence can include: Expressions, poses, comic mishaps, jokes, visual puns, incongruity, exaggeration, slapstick, meme-like situations, embarrassing moments, ridiculous reactions, or behavior whose absurdity or incongruity produces amusement.\n🤣 Emoji contribution: Doubled-over laughter, tears of laughter, losing composure, slapstick payoff, ridiculous reactions, meme exaggeration, explosive amusement, contagious laughter, punch-line energy, and scenes that feel impossible to take seriously can reinforce Funny."},{"id":"P05","name":"Intense","symbol":"💥","aiMeaning":"Force, energy, drama, urgency, extremity, power, impact, excitement, danger, speed, violence, passion, tension, chaos, pressure, adrenaline, volatility, sensory overload, or emotional extremity.\nEvidence can include: Explosions, action, confrontation, extreme expressions, dramatic motion, powerful bodies, storms, spectacle, high stakes, tense stand-offs, chaotic environments, sudden escalation, overwhelming sensory presence, or visually forceful scenes.\n💥 Emoji contribution: Explosions, collisions, impacts, crashes, strikes, bursts, breakage, shock waves, blasts, comic-book action marks, sudden escalation, kinetic force, loudness, urgency, disruption, and moments that visually land hard can reinforce Intense."},{"id":"P06","name":"Weird","symbol":"🌀","aiMeaning":"Strangeness, oddity, uncanniness, abnormality, eccentricity, unpredictability, surrealism, mutation, bizarre combinations, perceptual wrongness, or departure from ordinary expectations.\nEvidence can include: Unusual bodies, strange objects, impossible scenes, mismatched elements, distortions, peculiar behavior, unfamiliar forms, uncanny juxtapositions, reality-bending imagery, or anything that makes the viewer think “what the hell?”\n🌀 Emoji contribution: Spirals, vortices, whirlpools, warped perspective, trippy visual effects, looping motion, hypnosis imagery, dizziness, disorientation, perceptual instability, twisting forms, altered orientation, and a sense that reality is slipping out of alignment can reinforce Weird."},{"id":"P07","name":"Ticket","symbol":"🎟️","aiMeaning":"Inappropriate amusement, callousness, taboo enjoyment, schadenfreude, morbid fascination, cruel humor, social transgression, laughing at things that should not be funny, or emotional responses wildly opposed to what society considers acceptable. This captures enjoying cruelty, laughing at tragedy, amusement where empathy is expected, fascination with disturbing material, or reactions that sharply violate social norms.\nEvidence can include: Cruel or humiliating situations treated as entertainment, another person’s misfortune producing amusement, taboo spectacle, train-wreck fascination, vulgar or outrageous behavior, disturbing material that is compelling to watch, social boundary violations, or enjoyment that conflicts sharply with expected empathy or decorum.\n🎟️ Emoji contribution: Admission tickets, event entry, spectatorship, paying to watch, carnival or sideshow imagery, being granted a pass, and metaphorically buying admission to a questionable spectacle can reinforce Ticket through willing spectatorship, complicity, taboo entertainment, or attraction to material that violates social expectations."},{"id":"P08","name":"Dreamy","symbol":"🌌","aiMeaning":"Fantasy, reverie, wonder, escapism, imagination, enchantment, altered reality, surrealism, nostalgia, longing, dream-state, or otherworldliness.\nEvidence can include: Fantasy worlds, impossible landscapes, ethereal or unreal spaces, magical imagery, mist, stars, celestial vistas, altered environments, nostalgic imagery, imaginative transformations, distant horizons, contemplative unreality, dream logic, or scenes that feel transported beyond ordinary life.\n🌌 Emoji contribution: The Milky Way, stars, galaxies, deep night sky, cosmic landscapes, space, distant lights, celestial scale, infinity, mystery, transcendence, cosmic wonder, science-fiction vistas, human smallness before a vast universe, and transportive otherworldliness can reinforce Dreamy."},{"id":"P09","name":"Zazzly","symbol":"🌶️","aiMeaning":"Sexual salience, erotic appeal, physical desirability, horniness, seductive or provocative presentation, body-focused attraction, flirtation, sexual tension, or imagery likely to be perceived as sexy, hot, spicy, revealing, tempting, or turn-on oriented.\nEvidence includes nudity or partial nudity; exposed chest, breasts, nipples, buttocks, crotch, genitals, pubic area, torso, or abundant skin; prominently displayed sexually salient body parts or features such as pecs, abs, hips, thighs, legs, curves, musculature, physique, body proportions, or large or emphasized buttocks. It also includes tight or form-fitting clothing, leggings, compression wear, singlets, athletic outfits, uniforms, body-hugging costumes, underwear, lingerie, briefs, boxers, panties, thongs, jockstraps, bikinis, speedos, revealing swimwear, mesh, sheer clothing, towels, robes, bedsheet coverage, or clothing that reveals, frames, or emphasizes the body.\nBody-display routes include mirror selfies, nude or shirtless selfies, underwear selfies, gym, bathroom, or bedroom selfies, thirst traps, posed body shots, flexing, arching, spread or open-leg posing, chest-, butt-, crotch-, or physique-focused framing, and deliberate body display. Exposure routes include casual or public nudity, nude beaches, skinny-dipping, streaking, flashing, deliberate exposure, undressing, changing clothes, locker-room or shower scenes, towel scenes, wet skin, wet clothing, exhibitionistic display, or being intentionally seen naked or partly naked. Sensual routes include intimate or flirtatious gaze, teasing, provocative expressions, erotic or fetish styling, suggestive framing, seductive atmosphere, or visible sexual tension.\nExpansion rule: Zazzly does not require sexual activity, explicit arousal, a stereotypically seductive pose, fetish content, or an invitation to sex. Casual nudity independently supports Zazzly. Any mirror selfie independently supports at least some Zazzly because it is deliberate self-presentation and body display, even when fully clothed or not overtly sexual. Any adult body type may qualify when sexual or sensual presentation is visually emphasized. Beautiful may score separately for non-human aesthetics, but it must not replace or suppress Zazzly when sexual salience is present.\nAge gate: Apply sexualized Zazzly interpretation only to adult subjects. Do not infer sexual attractiveness or erotic appeal from minors.","publicMeaningHidden":true},{"id":"P10","name":"Disgusting","symbol":"🤢","aiMeaning":"Disgust, revulsion, nausea, contamination, filth, bodily aversion, decay, grossness, gross-out reaction, grotesque unpleasantness, moral revulsion, or an instinctive desire to recoil.\nEvidence can include: Rot, slime, wounds, bodily fluids, spoiled food, parasites, infection, excrement, gore, grime, malformed organic matter, contamination, foul substances, or anything viscerally gross.\n🤢 Emoji contribution: A nauseated face, sickness, gagging, queasiness, foul smells, spoiled food, poisoning, infection, toxic substances, bodily illness, rancidness, contamination, and cues that trigger physical recoil or a “that makes me sick” response can reinforce Disgusting."},{"id":"P11","name":"Scary","symbol":"👻","aiMeaning":"Fear, dread, unease, threat, suspense, vulnerability, danger, horror, paranoia, menace, foreboding, creepiness, alarm, or anticipation that something harmful or uncanny may happen.\nEvidence can include: Monsters, darkness, weapons, threatening people, isolation, disturbing faces, supernatural imagery, stalking, dangerous environments, ominous situations, unseen threats, predatory presence, eerie emptiness, or subtle wrongness.\n👻 Emoji contribution: Ghosts, spirits, apparitions, haunted places, spectral figures, paranormal presences, unseen watchers, Halloween imagery, death or afterlife imagery, jump-scare cues, spooky playfulness, eerie presence, haunting, supernatural unease, and something impossible appearing where it should not be can reinforce Scary."},{"id":"P12","name":"Smart","symbol":"🧠","aiMeaning":"Intelligence, thought, cognition, knowledge, cleverness, psychology, conceptual complexity, strategy, learning, insight, invention, ingenuity, reasoning, intellectual curiosity, mental effort, or fascination with how minds work.\nEvidence can include: Science, mathematics, books, puzzles, planning, symbolism, intellectual humor, psychological states, technical or computational reasoning, ingenious design, problem-solving, conceptual cleverness, visibly thoughtful behavior, learning, analysis, or evidence of deliberate mental work.\n🧠 Emoji contribution: The literal brain, anatomy, neuroscience, neural imagery, memory, cognition, consciousness, psychology, thought diagrams, brain scans, artificial intelligence, mind maps, “big brain” cleverness, overthinking, strategy, introspection, mental effort, and curiosity about how thought works can reinforce Smart."},{"id":"P13","name":"Celebration","symbol":"🎉","aiMeaning":"Happiness expressed through celebration, festivity, achievement, gathering, excitement, communal joy, triumph, revelry, applause, victory, milestones, special occasions, or marking something positively significant.\nEvidence can include: Parties, cheering, dancing, birthdays, holidays, weddings, trophies, confetti, decorations, crowds, congratulations, victories, launches, awards, good-news announcements, milestone moments, or ceremonies and rituals presented as celebratory.\n🎉 Emoji contribution: Party poppers, confetti, streamers, congratulatory bursts, surprise announcements, party supplies, victories, birthdays, milestones, launches, applause, achievements, “yay!” energy, and visible moments of good news or success can reinforce Celebration."},{"id":"P14","name":"Angry","symbol":"🤬","aiMeaning":"Anger, annoyance, irritation, aggravation, frustration, hostility, resentment, defiance, confrontation, outrage, aggression, rage, feeling fed up, or the reaction that something “pisses you off.”\nEvidence can include: Annoyed or furious expressions, yelling, arguing, clenched fists, hostile gestures, threats, fighting, destruction, revenge behavior, protest, intimidation, antagonism, simmering resentment, visible frustration, or escalating confrontation.\n🤬 Emoji contribution: An enraged face, censored symbols over the mouth, shouting, profanity, swearing, rants, insults, verbal confrontation, explosive facial expressions, exasperation, being fed up, loss of polite restraint, censored verbal aggression, and cartoon rage can reinforce Angry across the spectrum from irritation to fury."}],"fusions":[{"code":"PFM0102","name":"Cozy","primIds":["P01","P02"],"matrixVersion":"0.0.0.0","aiMeaning":"Comforting, snug, warm, sheltered, or inviting;

const THEME_SEMANTIC_EVIDENCE_RULES = `SEMANTIC EVIDENCE DISCIPLINE:
- Cue ≠ meaning. The mere presence of an object, color, pose, creature, room state, or other cue is not Theme evidence unless that cue actually carries the Theme's meaning in context.
- Modifiers matter. Do not silently change what a word modifies: visual quantity is not excessive sweetness; generic clutter alone is not sparseness, grime, hoarding, carnival display, or distorted reality; an ordinary pose is not automatically comic, eccentric, helpless, or romantic.
- Do not manufacture evidence from interpretation. A conclusion such as “surreal,” “liminal,” “zany,” “horror,” or “medicated” cannot be recycled as proof of the conditions that supposedly justify it.
- Keep ambiguous cues ambiguous until independent evidence supports a more specific interpretation. Closed eyes can mean rest; a distant gaze can have many causes; a still image can support persistence only through visible accumulated consequences or other concrete evidence.
- Identify the actual semantic route that earns a match. If a broad definition has several routes, name the route supported by the image instead of inventing a different one.
- Confidence must track demonstrated evidence. 100 means exceptionally complete and essentially unmistakable, not merely plausible. A forced top-three choice may legitimately have modest confidence if it is only the closest available Theme.`;

DIAGNOSTIC CALL FORMAT: ${callLabel}
EVIDENCE SOURCE COMBINATION: ${sourceLabel}
${evidenceText}

Evaluate EACH of the ${count} concepts below INDEPENDENTLY against the available evidence and against its exact current Worker definition.

SCORING RULES:
- Give every concept its own 0-100 MATCH CONFIDENCE. These scores are independent. They do NOT add to 100, are NOT shares of a pool, and must NOT be normalized against one another.
- Do NOT choose three winners. Do NOT rank concepts as a substitute for scoring them.
- Base the score on the supplied definition. The purpose is to discover what the AI sees, does not see, understands, misunderstands, or fails to associate with the definition.
- Assess EVERY explicitly identified definition component for EVERY concept. Do not collapse the definition into one generalized judgment.
- A 0% score requires the same complete component-by-component analysis as a high score.
- Confidence calibration: 0 = no meaningful positive support or a hard gate makes the concept inapplicable; 1-19 = trace/tenuous; 20-39 = weak but real; 40-59 = moderate/mixed; 60-79 = strong; 80-94 = very strong/direct; 95-100 = exceptionally complete/unmistakable. 100 requires essentially no meaningful doubt. 0 requires essentially no positive match evidence unless a hard gate overrides it.
- Genuine positive supporting evidence should normally move the score above 0. Missing, ambiguous, or contradictory evidence should explain why a score is below 100.
- High confidence must be justified by concrete component-level support. Do not inflate confidence because a concept is merely plausible.
- For PrimFusion Themes, judge the fusion Theme's own supplied definition; do not automatically infer it from its two Prims.
- Standalone Prims are diagnostic building blocks only and cannot become final Genreactrix Themes.
- If an evidence source is silent on something, say so. Do not invent missing evidence.
- Cue ≠ meaning. Do not promote an ordinary cue into a more specific semantic claim without independent evidence.
- Do not infer dirt from clutter, hoarding from generic mess, clinical setting from ordinary room objects, romance from a gaze, supernatural danger from an inactive object, distorted reality from confusion, or performance/spectacle from mere oddness.
- The component findings, numeric score, and final WHY must agree. Do not give a high score and then say there is no evidence, insufficient information, or that the concept is unsupported.
- FINAL SCORE SELF-CHECK: Before writing each final score and WHY, re-read that concept's completed component assessments and reasons and evaluate the score again from those findings. If the proposed score conflicts with your own assessment, revise the score. Assessment -> score, never score -> assessment. Do not invent new evidence during this self-check.
- Evaluate only the target concept. Do not compare it to or explain it through unrelated concepts in the same call.
- When a concept matches through one specific route in a broad definition, identify that actual route in the reason.

For each definition component use exactly one assessment label:
- MATCH_EVIDENCE = positive evidence that raises confidence in the concept.
- GATE_CONFIRMED = a limiting/non-qualifier rule is correctly recognized; this validates the gate but does not itself raise match confidence.
- PARTIAL = some but incomplete/ambiguous positive support.
- ABSENT = the component's positive evidence is not present.
- CONTRADICTS = evidence points against the component/concept.
- NOT_OBSERVABLE = the available evidence cannot establish it.
Legacy SUPPORTS is accepted by the Worker as MATCH_EVIDENCE, but prefer the labels above.

OUTPUT: plain text only. Markdown decoration is unnecessary. The Worker accepts minor punctuation variation, but EVERY required record identifier below must be present so each judgment can be tied to the exact definition component.
Use this shape:
P01 SCORE 72
P01.01 MATCH_EVIDENCE - concrete evidence-grounded reason
P01 WHY - explanation of why the component findings justify the final score

Do not substitute a paragraph such as "Definition / Evidence / Score" for the numbered component records.
Do not skip numbered components even at 0%.

SCORING RULES:
- Produce an independent 0-100 match confidence for this concept only.
- Assess every numbered definition component separately, including at 0%.
- Use MATCH_EVIDENCE for positive match evidence, GATE_CONFIRMED for correctly applied limiting/non-qualifier rules, or PARTIAL, ABSENT, CONTRADICTS, NOT_OBSERVABLE as appropriate. Legacy SUPPORTS is accepted as MATCH_EVIDENCE.
- The final score must follow from the component-level findings and use the calibration: 0 none/hard-gated; 1-19 trace; 20-39 weak; 40-59 moderate; 60-79 strong; 80-94 very strong/direct; 95-100 exceptionally complete/unmistakable.
- Cue ≠ meaning. Do not invent evidence or promote an ambiguous cue into a specific cause.
- Keep this concept isolated from unrelated concepts in the same wave.
- The component findings, numeric score, and WHY must agree.
- FINAL SCORE SELF-CHECK: Before returning the score, re-read the completed component assessments and reasons and evaluate the score again from those findings. If the proposed score conflicts with your own assessment, revise the score. Assessment -> score, never score -> assessment. Do not invent new evidence during this self-check.
- Do not collapse the definition into a single Evidence paragraph.

REPAIR RULES:
- Replace every <ASSESSMENT> placeholder with an actual allowed assessment token. The literal text <ASSESSMENT> is invalid output.
- Use MATCH_EVIDENCE only for positive evidence that raises confidence.
- Use GATE_CONFIRMED when a limiting/non-qualifier rule is correctly recognized; it does not itself raise confidence.
- Also allowed: PARTIAL, ABSENT, CONTRADICTS, NOT_OBSERVABLE.
- Confidence calibration: 0 none/hard-gated; 1-19 trace; 20-39 weak; 40-59 moderate; 60-79 strong; 80-94 very strong/direct; 95-100 exceptionally complete/unmistakable.
- The numeric score, every component finding, and WHY must agree.
- FINAL SCORE SELF-CHECK: Before returning the score, re-read the completed component assessments and reasons and evaluate the score again from those findings. If the proposed score conflicts with your own assessment, revise the score. Assessment -> score, never score -> assessment. Do not invent new evidence during this self-check.
- Evaluate only ${concept.code} ${concept.name}. Do not mention or compare unrelated concepts from the same wave.
- Do not invent dirt, hoarding, romance, clinical setting, supernatural danger, altered reality, performance, spectacle, or any other specific condition unless the available evidence actually supports it.
- If the concept fits through one route in a broad definition, identify that route explicitly.
